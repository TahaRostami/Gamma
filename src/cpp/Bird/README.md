my_impl_o__recomp_based_unidom.cpp: 

it is my implementation of Bird's thesis but using recomputation based method. 
Here, I implemented boudning strategy 1, 2 and 3 proposed by him.
Also, I added code for supporting our theorem which add constraints on the number of queens per rows and columns.
Moreover, this code uses all these theorems and bounding strategies togenther and in a cascading fashion.
(till now the best results have been achieved using this impl.)

unidom_bounding_strategy_2.cpp:

it is my implemntation of boudning stratgey of Bird's thesis based on the pseudocode and explnation provided in his thesis.
