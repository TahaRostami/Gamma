It was close to new year's holiday, and having meeting was infeasible. 
I had some questions regarding 'trail' in the 'IPASIR_UP' interface.
For the moment, I added a function named 'value' to the cadical's code.
So, I could prevent using 'trail' related things for the moment.
This code integrates bounding strategy 2 proposed by Bird with cadical using 'IPASIR_UP' interface.
