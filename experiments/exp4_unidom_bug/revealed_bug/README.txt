Please note that these codes are simplified. In practice, it may be safer to discard any solutions larger than expected from Unidom's output. This is because Unidom might produce its best-found solutions among the allocated search tree nodes, which could potentially interfere with the current version of the visualization codes.

However, I manually checked Unidom's output for these specific runs, and no such issues were encountered.
